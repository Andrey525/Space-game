# Hello, this is my first gamedev project!
## All you need to start playing:
1. Install SFML - sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
2. Build the project - make
3. Play - ./bin/prog

P.S. 

1. The game is written for Linux.
SFML is easily installed on ubuntu by the command from point 1. 
There may be some difficulties with installing SFML on other distributions,
 and you may have to do it manually and change the Makefile 
  (see the official SFML docs for what to do).
2. The game is launched from the folder where the Makefile is located by the command ./bin/prog, and nothing else.
